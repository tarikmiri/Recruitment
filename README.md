# Snakes and Ladders

Snakes and Ladders is a board game involving two or more players rolling dice in order to move their tokens across a board. The board is made up of a collection of numbered squares and is adorned with 'snakes' and 'ladders', which link two squares on the board- snakes link the squares downwards whilst ladders link them going upwards. This means that landing at the bottom of a ladder moves you to the top of that ladder, whereas landing on the top of a snake moves you to the bottom of that snake. The objective of the game is to get your token to the final square before your opponents do.
