# The Task

Snakes and Ladders is a board game involving two or more players rolling dice in order to move their tokens across a board. The board is made up of a collection of numbered squares and is adorned with 'snakes' and 'ladders', which link two squares on the board- snakes link the squares downwards whilst ladders link them going upwards. This means that landing at the bottom of a ladder moves you to the top of that ladder, whereas landing on the top of a snake moves you to the bottom of that snake. The objective of the game is to get your token to the final square before your opponents do.

# Requirements

For this technical assignment, you are requested to build a small application to implement the snakes and ladder board game. We ask you to create your own repository to host your solution.

Below are some user stories that can help you designing the solution.

* As a player I want to be able to move my token So that I can get closer to the goal
* As a player I want to move my token based on the roll of a die So that there is an element of chance in the game
* As a player I want to be able to win the game So that I can gloat to everyone around
* As a player I want snakes to move my token down So that the game is more fun
* As a player I want ladders to move my token up So that the game is more fun

# Insights

The goal of this test is to objectively evaluate your technical skills, here are some insights into what we will be looking for when reviewing your solution.

* Feel free to commit as often as you'd like. The more commits the better! Please commit at least once within the first hour
* It's better to complete 1 task than to start 3
* Feel free to use any libraries you feel appropriate
* We will be looking at how you approach the task (e.g. how you break it into sub-tasks) and how you structure your code
